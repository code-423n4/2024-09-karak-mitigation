## Findings being mitigated

Mitigations of all High and Medium issues (+ Additional Issues to be mitigated) will be considered in-scope and listed here.

- [M-03: When malicious behavior occurs and DSS requests slashing against vault during 2 day period after SLASHING_WINDOW of 7 days is passed after staker initiates a withdrawal, token amount to be slashed is calculated to be higher than what it should be](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-karak-findings/issues/17)

Additional issues to be mitigated:
- [ADD-01]: packages/contracts/src/NativeVault.sol L446 `+ node.withdrawableCreditedNodeETH -= slashedWithdrawable;`
- [ADD-02]: packages/contracts/src/entities/NativeVaultLib.sol L177-L178
```
  validatorDetails.lastBalanceUpdateTimestamp =
            node.currentSnapshotTimestamp == 0 ? node.lastSnapshotTimestamp : node.currentSnapshotTimestamp;
```

## Overview of changes

Karak Restaking is a protocol that allows users to restake their assets by directly depositing them into the vaults of operators. Operators can then register with Distributed Secure Services (DSS) to provide economic security. Operators perform tasks for the DSS in exchange for rewards, and the DSS has the ability to slash the funds that operators have delegated.

| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-arena-mitigations/commit/fdef9d25e2b7c0a528d5a6dfcce64a3a518165af#diff-940446432243a929cd0f5ea691c4e90d60ee655723e2d5d8fcafc7b7504cfe98R429 | H-02 | This mitigation removes the SlashStore altogether and the NativeVault itself burns the slashed ETH |
| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-arena-mitigations/commit/fdef9d25e2b7c0a528d5a6dfcce64a3a518165af#diff-940446432243a929cd0f5ea691c4e90d60ee655723e2d5d8fcafc7b7504cfe98R216 | H-03 | This mitigation introduces a check for the rounding error |

| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-arena-mitigations/commit/af49375f2f7682b6372477d68d367f2dee4256ca | M-02| This mitigation accounts for the decrease in balance of the users shares before burning |
| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-arena-mitigations/commit/71b4d9609b441072d2e0da62d67d6ad6cec0e550 | M-03 | This mitigation computes the slashing amount in finalize slashing |
