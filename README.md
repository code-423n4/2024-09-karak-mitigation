## Overview of changes

Karak Restaking is a protocol that allows users to restake their assets by directly depositing them into the vaults of operators. Operators can then register with Distributed Secure Services (DSS) to provide economic security. Operators perform tasks for the DSS in exchange for rewards, and the DSS has the ability to slash the funds that operators have delegated.

### Mitigation of High & Medium Severity Issues


| URL | Mitigation of | Purpose | 
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-restaking/pull/380/files#diff-62a4c2a33a1406e2fd41853e17947e8b72064dbec391332220e5ebb93216bea0R437 | H-01 | This mitigation only burns the ETH that has already been credited to the user consequently avoiding this scenario |
| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-restaking/pull/380/files#diff-62a4c2a33a1406e2fd41853e17947e8b72064dbec391332220e5ebb93216bea0R429 | H-02 | This mitigation removes the SlashStore altogether and the NativeVault itself burns the slashed ETH |
| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-restaking/pull/380/files#diff-62a4c2a33a1406e2fd41853e17947e8b72064dbec391332220e5ebb93216bea0R431 | H-03 | This mitigation introduces a check for the rounding error |
| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-restaking/pull/365 | H-04 | This mitigation validates the operator, vaults status in the finalizing slashing |
| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-restaking/pull/434 | M-02| This mitigation accounts for the decrease in balance of the users shares before burning |
| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-restaking/pull/385 | M-03 | This mitigation computes the slashing amount in finalize slashing |
| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-restaking/pull/383 | M-04 | This mitigation exposes a getter to determine if a vault's queued for slashing |
| https://github.com/karak-network/karak-restaking/pull/365 | M-05 | This mitigation skips the slashing incase of `0` slashing amount |
